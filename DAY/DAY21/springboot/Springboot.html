There was an unexpected error (type=Not Found, status=404).)

~~~~I am getting this in my local browser~~~~




At first, i did get 'Hello world'in my local browser by following the steps in concept section.But in the Assignment , the tasks (
1. Create a new endpoint `/greet/{name}` that accepts a path parameter representing a person's name and returns a personalized greeting. For example, a request to `/greet/John` should return "Hello, John!".
2. Implement error handling for invalid or empty name values. Return an appropriate error message and status code when the name parameter is missing or blank.
3. Add a new endpoint `/greet/{name}/{language}` that accepts both name and language parameters. Return a greeting message based on the specified language. For example, `/greet/John/es` should return "Hola, John!" for Spanish.
4. Implement support for handling HTTP POST requests. Create an endpoint `/greet` that accepts a JSON payload with a name field and returns a greeting message. Test this endpoint using tools like cURL or Postman.
5. Add unit tests to verify the behavior of the new endpoints. Write test cases to cover different scenarios, including valid and invalid inputs.

which was assigned to me ,i didn't fully grasp it, and so i was not able to do any further modifications by my own.
Though i was trying to take help from resources, i am getting syntax error in my code (both in main and tests).
In cmd, i was getting BUILD : FAILURE whenever i tried to write/add/modify some code on my own in @rest controller,@getmapping,
@postmapping,@tests.
